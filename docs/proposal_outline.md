# EuroHPC Development Access Proposal

## 1. Abstract
- We propose to scale our Monte Carlo simulation to 100+ nodes to improve accuracy for financial modeling.

## 2. Objectives
- Measure weak scaling efficiency on massive datasets.
- Test mixed-precision (float32 vs float64) for speed gains.

## 3. Resource Request
- We request: 10,000 Node Hours.
- Justification: Monte Carlo requires billions of samples for high precision.
